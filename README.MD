Java 8 or greater is needed to run the game on Linux, Mac and Windows

Processing is required in order to build the game


## Installation

Just execute the application corresponding to your system, under the `bin` directory.

For Android, download the apk to your phone and install it (you will need to uncheck *"Never install applications from untrusted sources"* configuration option)

## How to play

Click the "Jouer" button (Play in French)

Then you need to launch the satellite to the green planet, avoiding red planets attracting you.
